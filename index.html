                    Hi, I work conservation of computer and software based artworks primarily at the
                    San Francicso Museum of Modern Art. I'd like to share with two recent projects I've worked on at the
                    museum.

                News, Hans Haacke 1969/2008/2018
                <aside class="notes">
                    One of the first electronic artworks to feature a live feed in the gallery, Haackeâ€™s News (1969)
                    consists of a real time printed newsfeed. A pile of paper grows as it spills from the printer on the
                    table onto the floor, and visitors are welcome to pick up portions to read. News does not analyze
                    news content but simply delivers it, spewing out stories upon stories.

                    News was acquired in 2008 by SFMOMA with a new version of software. As teletype systems and the
                    networks
                    that inform them no longer exists, the work was adapted to print on a dot matix printer via really
                    simple syndication(RSS) feed.

                    News was to be re-ehxbited at SFMOMA in 2018 fro the Nothing Stable under Heaven show. I was asked
                    to re-write the software as the o 2008 version had become obsolete.

                    In this image, a part of the 2018 sofware is shown. 

                    In the rewrite we worked closely with the artists studio, which provided a set of parameters
                    Artist parameters, for example:

                    b) Any printer that produces the news bulletins on paper as they come in, dot matrix or other. In
                    case such paper print-outs can technically no longer be produced in the future, an LED or a
                    comparable presentation could be considered.

                    In getting the digital files of of these there were many challenges. The 3 1/4 floppy disks that
                    they were on were obsolete. The file systems on the floppies could not be read by modern computers.
                    And the file formats that the images were saved in had become obsolete long ago.

                    We used the Kryoflux hadware which is a floppy disk controller for moderm computers. This come from
                    the software preservation society.

                    We made extensive use of emulators to access the file systems and formats.

                    Access for curator was a challenge so we we set up a web-based emulator to they could review the icons in their
                    original operating system from a webpage
